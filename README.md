# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
This Repo is for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project.
In this project I seek to find out the best restaurant that is near the UC Hastings College of the Law. I am interested in the good restaurants here because I will be studying at the UC Davis MSBA, which is hosted at the UC Hastings College of the Law.
