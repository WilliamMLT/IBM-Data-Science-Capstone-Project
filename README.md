### Capstone_Final_Submission.ipynb
This is the final Capstone Project Subject 

In this project I seek to find out the best restaurant that is within 1000m of the UC Hastings College of the Law. I am interested to find out the good restaurants in the vincinity because I will be studying at the UC Davis MSBA, which is hosted at the UC Hastings College of the Law.

There are 2 data sources:
1. Geopy to extract location for UC Hastings College of the Law
2. Restaurant data and location is extracted using Foursquare API
